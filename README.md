# mathematical-modeling-competitions
 The code comes from various algorithms and codes summarized in multiple mathematical modeling competitions, and the models include:

1、 Planning model

(1) Linear programming

Both linear and nonlinear programming problems generally seek maximum and minimum values, using the smallest limited resources to seek maximum benefits, and so on.

(2) Integer Programming

The solution is similar to linear programming, but its decision variables x1, x2, and other constraints are integer optimization problems.

（3）0-1 Planning

A special type of integer programming whose decision variable can only be 0 or 1. The problem of n individuals assigning n tasks.


(4) Nonlinear programming

The optimization problem where the objective function or the existence constraint function is a nonlinear function of the decision variable.


(5) Multiobjective planning

Study the optimization of more than one objective function over a given region. Let's find a single objective and use it as a constraint to find another objective when the single objective is optimal.


(6) Dynamic planning

A branch of operations research. The process of optimizing a decision-making process.


II Analytic Hierarchy Process

It is a systematic and hierarchical analysis method that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis, mainly including mechanism analysis and statistical analysis.


3、 Principal component analysis

The high correlation between indicators is not conducive to establishing the principle of independence that indicators follow. Indicators should be independent of each other and not related to each other.


4、 Cluster analysis


5、 Interpolation and fitting


6、 Monte Carlo algorithm


7、 Graph theory algorithm

(1) . Shortest circuit

(2) . Network Flow

(3) . Bipartite graph

8、 BP neural network prediction


9、 Particle Swarm Optimization


10、 Genetic algorithm


11、 Grey prediction model


12、 Time series prediction


13、 Queuing Theory and Computer Simulation
